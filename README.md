## Introduction

Introduction

+ Dash is built upon Flask.
+ Matplotlib creates static image files
+ Seaborn is designed to ctaete nice looking statistical plots (static plots)
+ Plotly:
  + is the open source library which is a general data visualization librray focused on **interactive** visualizations
  + has libraries for JavaScript, React, R, and Python (the most popular version is the Python library)
  + using plotly Python library we can craete interactive plots as **.html** files
  + while users can still interact with these plots (zoom in, select, hover over), these plots cannot be connected to chaniging data sources that is why we need Dash
  + so plotly is great when we want some little interactive image that you knwo the data source behind it is going to be static and not changing
+ Dash:
  + we often want plots to be able to interact with each other, interact with components, or have plots update in real time. To accomplish these we need a dashboard
  + Dash is an open source librray from the Plotly company that allows you to create a full dashboard with multiple components, interactivity, and multiple plots
  + Dash produces a dashboard web applicationin in which we can interact with the dashboard
  + since Dash renders a full web app, we can then deploy our dashboards online for other people to use
